# Features
- Ability to change the SEO for every page: Page title, Meta Description, Meta Keywords, Link title ( Url Segment for the page )
- All pages automaticly get a search engine friendly URL, you have the ability to change the uri segment for the page from the CMS
- All pages automatically get Open Graph Meta Tags. So when you share the link to a page on facebook or other social media platforms these platforms will be able to pull the proper information
- Every time you save a page in the CMS it will automatically create a history version which you can then reload and publish LIVE again.
- The HTML structure of the page and the Content of the page are clearly seperated and both the Content and the HTML structure for the page can be edited directly in the CMS, there is no need to use a 3rd party editor or to use FTP, this speeds up the time it takes to make changes on the website.  
- Since the HTML structure and the content are clearly seperated you do not need to worry about having the client change any of the HTML structure.
- Ability to save as draft, you can come back and make changes to the draft page later, you can even send links to the draft version of the page inorder to get approval, and then push the page LIVE once you are done.
- Ability to create custom fields with their own unique layouts. You can create new Fields in the CMS directly, no need to hardcode anything in the code behind. The CMS comes with several field types already prebuilt, so you do not even need to know programming inorder to add new fields, however if you do know programming ( Razor Engine Code ) you can program it to do anything you like, you have complete freedome over the HTML that is generated.
- Ability to modify the layout of all pages with a specific page type or unlink from a page type and create a unique layout for every page. Every page in the CMS has a type, so you can either have it so that it would use the style of the page type, or have it so that it has its own unique layout.
- Ability to add new languages to each page with ease. You have the ability to define as many languages as you like, you can then simply browse to a page and then switch the language and save and publish and your done, you have now created a new language version of the page.
- Built in Blog functionality, including moderated blog posts
- You have control over caching of pages. If you have set all pages to cache, the first time a visitor visits the page, it will generate a file system cache for that page and the next time the request will load from cache, drasticly speeding up performance. 
- Attempts to Load from cache if there is an error connecting to the database. If you have the page cached and there is an error connecting to the database, the system will attempt to load that page from cache if it exists.
- Ability to automatically publish a page live at a specified date time
- Ability to automatically take down a page at a specified date time
- Ability to create 301 or 302 redirects. You can create your own url redirect rules, you can have it so that /oldpage is redirected to /about/contact/

- Ability to Add / Edit / Delete Glossary terms.
- Ability to Create, Edit, Delete/Recover, Permanently Delete, Hide/Show, Duplicate and Publish/unpublish pages 
- Ability to create Protected Pages ( Only logged in users, in the frontend can access these pages )
- Ability to clear all cache
- Ability to search for a page based on any field value in the backend for quick access
- You can view the email logs from the CMS ( provided the emails were sent using the system its self )
- You can view the error logs from the CMS 
- Ability to limit access to a page or a page type ( role based ). Only people that belong to the role can access these pages in the CMS
- When you edit content and save it you can see how it looks right away in the browser panel instead of having to open a new window and browse to the page
- You can resize the browser panel and see how the site looks in different sizes i.e test responsive layout directly through the cms
