## Single Page App / Universal App
- Automatic Single Page App functionality with SSR ( Server Side Rendering ) via the Single Page App library that I built ( https://github.com/MacdonaldRobinson/jquery-ajax-loader )
- Since the page is rendered Server Side on the first request, you dont run into any SEO issues as you would in a classic SPA
- Since the pages are rendred Server Side, you do not lose any of the functionality offered by the CMS like frontend editing / dynamic nav generation based on the site tree in the CMS

## Static File Generator
- The CMS is also a Static File Generator which builds static pages and stores them in the Cache folder, and then on every other request it loads the page via cache making the performance extremely fast ( Please view the Cache section below to see how caching works )
  - Please note that these static files are dynamicly generated based on changes made in the CMS, so there is no need of a build  and deployment process

## Headless CMS
- Comes with a API that allows you to load content via AJAX which means you can use the CMS as a Headless CMS ( /WebServices/Site.asmx/GetField?id=11145&fieldCode=TestField ) 

## Works well with other Javascript Frameworks like React / Vue / Angular
- If you prefer to not use the built in SPA library, you could use any other javascript framework and place it in the "Frontend" folder, the only thing you need to do is to make sure that you are loading the index page from the frontend folder from the layout section in the CMS i.e include the file in the Layout section using {IncludeFile:'/Frontend/PATH_TO_INDEX_FILE'}

## Editing
- FrontEnd Editing: Every field can be edited from the frontend of the website
- Visual Layout Editor ( Experimental ): Once logged into the cms and browsing the frontend of the website, you can toggle the visual layout editor, which allows you to create, delete, reorder the rows, columns and fields
- Every time you save a page in the CMS it will automatically create a history version which you can then reload and publish LIVE again.
- The HTML structure of the page and the Content of the page are clearly seperated and both the Content and the HTML structure for the page can be edited directly in the CMS, there is no need to use a 3rd party editor or to use FTP, this speeds up the time it takes to make changes on the website.  
  - Since the HTML structure and the content are clearly seperated you do not need to worry about having the client change any of the HTML structure.
- Ability to create custom fields with their own unique layouts. You can create new Fields in the CMS directly, no need to hardcode anything in the code behind. The CMS comes with several field types already prebuilt, so you do not even need to know programming inorder to add new fields, however if you do know programming ( Razor Engine Code ) you can program it to do anything you like, you have complete freedom over the HTML that is generated.
- Ability to modify the layout of all pages with a specific page type or unlink from a page type and create a unique layout for every page. Every page in the CMS has a type, so you can either have it so that it would use the style of the page type, or have it so that it has its own unique layout.
- When you edit content and save it you can see how it looks right away in the browser panel instead of having to open a new window and browse to the page
- You can resize the browser panel and see how the site looks in different sizes i.e test responsive layout directly through the cms
- You can create draft versions for pages which you can reload and edit at anytime
  - You will also get a visual indicator in the site tree besides pages that have a draft version.
  - The following indicators exist: "Will Publish", "Will Expire", "UnPublished", "HasDraft" along with a clock besides them if they are set to auto publish / auto expire

## Programming
- Programming in the CMS is done using C# and using the Razor Syntax
- Code is compiled and run on the fly using Razor Engine ( http://antaris.github.io/RazorEngine/ )
- You have access to the entire framework code, so you can pretty much do anything
- There are several Database Mappers and Helpers that are included with the framework.
- You can write Razor Code in any of the layout views in the CMS
- You can use short codes in any of the layout tabs and fields
- You can automatically execute some razor code when a page is published in the CMS by putting the code in the "On Publish Execute Code" Accordian tab under the Layouts tab for an individual page, or if you want to have the same code execute for all pages of the same type you can put this in the media type layouts section.
- Instead of programming directly in the CMS you can use an include ShortCode "{IncludeFile:'[Path-To-File]'}" which allows you to load a cshtml file, which will be executed at runtime, without any build process, kinda makes your workflow similar to PHP, simply make your change and refresh the page.


## Multi Language
- You can create as many languages in the CMS as you like.
- Ability to add new languages to each page with ease: You can simply browse to a page and then switch the language and save and publish and your done, you have now created a new language version of the page.

## Publishing 
- Ability to automatically publish a page live at a specified date time
- Ability to automatically take down a page at a specified date time
- Ability to save as draft, you can come back and make changes to the draft page later, you can even send links to the draft version of the page inorder to get approval, and then push the page LIVE once you are done. 
  - You can also set the draft version to automaticly get pushed live at a specified date time.

## SEO
- All pages automaticly get a search engine friendly URL, you have the ability to change the uri segment for the page from the CMS
- Ability to change the SEO for every page: Page title, Meta Description, Meta Keywords, Meta Robots, Link title ( Url Segment for the page )
- Ability to create 301 or 302 redirects. You can create your own url redirect rules, you can have it so that /oldpage is redirected to /about/contact/

## Caching
- You have 3 levels of caching: Memory Caching, File System Caching and Redis Caching
- You have control over caching of pages. If you have set all pages to cache, the first time a visitor visits the page, it will generate a cache for that page and the next time the request will load from cache, drasticly speeding up performance. 
- If the page is cached then it bypasses the database connection all together making the load time extreamly fast. 
- If you have the page cached and there is an error connecting to the database, the system will attempt to load that page from cache if it exists.
- You have the ability to clear the cache of an individual page.
- Ability to clear all cache

## Roles and Permissions
- Ability to Manage Users and Roles
- Ability to limit access to a page or a page type ( role based ). Only people that belong to the role can access these pages in the CMS
- Ability to automatically propigate role limitations to all child pages.
- You can enforce the role limitations in the frontend as well, so you need to be logged in with appropriate credentials inorder to view these pages in the frontend.

## Admin Tools
- Database Compare Tool: Allows you to compare 2 environments to see what has changed i.e New Pages, New Fields, Different Content  etc.
  - NOTE: This will only work if the 2 environments have the same database schema.
- Database Backup and Restore Tool: Allows you to backup the current database to a folder and displays a list of all backed up files, you can then restore from a backup file. 
  - NOTE: This only works if both the web application and the database are on the same server.
- You can view the email logs from the CMS ( provided the emails were sent using the system its self )
- You can view the error logs from the CMS
